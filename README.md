# easy dc solver
An algorithm for solving the Hamiltonian cycle problem deterministically and in linear time on all instances of discocube graphs (tested for up to 350 million vertices). Discocube graphs are
3-dimensional grid graphs derived from: a polycube of an octahedron | a Hauy construction of an octahedron using cubes as identical building blocks | the accretion of cubes around a central cube forming an octahedron at the limit |
the set of points in a 3-dimensional square grid graph contained within an octahedron...

*Planar embedding of a cube and a discocube. from the set of all graphs G, where the order of G is of the ***Uncentered octahedral numbers*** [A130809](https://oeis.org/A130809), only the first two instances shown above; n[0] and n[1] are planarly embeddable i.e., it can be represented on a two-dimensional surface without any of its edges crossing.*

This algorithm is an artist's rendering of a graph object using programming as a language (versus painting or singing about a mountain) and means by which to describe the body of his muse (a graph object) as an endless contour drawing (Hamiltonian cycle). 
After thousands of studies, drawings, and a little math: this is a story of how solving specific aethetic goals can yield results. When a graph becomes an artist's muse, how does the artist go about rendering their vision as a painter paints a portrait and makes it their own?
 Art studies forms, the curvature of the neck as it disappears into the back, the color in the foreground, so luminous, relegating all things beyond to irrelevance. So in this project, I studied the discocube as a body, where each turn was conceptualized not as a discrete math object but as movement of the body, resulting in more doodles and sketches than pages of equations. The result is a family of algorithms for solving various types of hamiltonian cycles (always turning, etc...), of which this repo is the simplest and most descriptive.

Why weave()? Finding the solution to the problem reminded me of macramé, of tying knots, weaving and how repeating certain movements resulted in certain patterns. I followed the thought further and asked myself if there was a 'weave' I could use to expose underlying unit structure and repeat this throughout to get an initial solution which could later be mutated to produce a more polished solution. The code is structured around the process of weaving a piece of tapestry, from spinning the yarn to incorporating the weft into the warps. 

There are no while loops, and will terminate after a series of steps have been performed. 
This algorithm aims, with enough optimizations, to be able to find the hamiltonian cycle for graphs up to a billion vertices. It takes only a little bit less time to certify a solution as it does to find it.
Not thinking it could be done until I actually did it: Learning to draw with my mind, using code to draw the object..


I hope that I've shared some insights (through code) I've gained by solving this problem having taken an approach similar to that of sculpting the human body...

Goal:
Optimize the algorithm so that it is able to solve instances of over a billion vertices:

*Discocubes 8 - 1760*

What started as a hack-your-own version of a depth-first-search-with-shortcuts for the discocube graph (solving up to 960 vertices), metastasized into pages of overgrown mixin classes mysteriously coupled to each another like overgrown vines pushing me deeper and deeper into the underbelly of its mutant tentacles. Although it was able to solve instances of over a million vertices, it had the clarity of primordial soup. So, as a sadistic gardener I painstakingly pruned my own unescapable web (all those letters you haven't opened yet?) of thorny vines into presentable tiny bonsai trees. So what is a bonsai if not a tree in intimate scope?

To paraphrase Hauy: 

*When solving problems that involve analyzing how nature progresses, we are led by very rapid methods to results that are not immediately obvious. These results may appear paradoxical and surprising. However, if we take the time to carefully examine the steps we took to reach these results, we will begin to understand the underlying principles that led to these outcomes. By going back over the process step by step, we can better understand the logic behind the final results.*

The result of this creative process is a family of algorithms developed specifically to solve various graph problems on the disoocube graph, 3d grid graph and hexprism honeycomb diamond graphs. 
The algorithm presented in this repository is the least complex, also making it the fastest. It does the job, solving the hamiltonian cycle problem for over millions of vertices in reasonable time (milliseconds vs. years), while others take longer but also have other objectives, like forming an always turning cycle with even edge distribution across all axes. But that's giving too much away... 

Eventually this repository will include other linear time algorithms for solving the hamiltonian cycle problem in 3d grid graphs and also in solid grid graphs, addressing some open issues raised in the graph theory research literature.

### digital discocubes
As each solution is as unique as a fingerprint, or a diamond it allows one to have their own digital version of a discocube, which is also an instruction for building your own.

*Discocubes as glb, using different mirrored texture yields personalized results and unique reflections meaning each discocube has its own reflection/shadow fingerprint! With millions of combinations available (glass texture/image/color, mirror texture/image/color, edge texture/image/color), the possibilities are endless!*

Please note: the hamiltonian cycle produced by this algorithm is the base form, without a high mutation rate. The polished versions available have no nonturns and all their edges are distributed evenly across the three axes.
The other algorithms I spoke of earlier accomplish this task.

## Command line usage
To use the package via the command line, navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run the following command:
```
cargo run --release [Graph start instance] [Graph end instance]
```
```
cargo run --release 1 100
```
build > run > make > solve > certify > for each graph starting from 32 to 1.373 million vertices.

### Solving the graph takes only a little longer than certifying the solution.
 I wonder if this could be a goal. Reduce the algorithm until it is as fast as the algorithm that certifies the graph.

UPDATE 1: TO BE CONTINUALLY OPTIMIZED TO SOLVE UP TO: | 🇳  1000 | ⭕️  1_337_336_000 BILLION VERTICES
UPDATE 2: ACTUALLY NOT, AS IT WOULD REQUIRE THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY LISTED BELOW TO ACCOMPLISH THE TASK. I ONLY HAVE 64 GB OF RAM 😢.
UPDATE 3: JOIN VERTICES + VI INTO A SINGLE STRUCTURE: AN INDEXABLE HASHMAP. LIKE AN ORDERED DICT IN PYTHON.
UPDATE 4: USING INDEXMAP RESULTS IN LONGER TIMES PROBABLY OWING TO HAVING TO ACCESS vertn[n].1 etc... vs. adj[n]
